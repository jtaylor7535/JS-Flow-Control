# JS-Flow-Control
JavaScript Flow Control Practice

## Description
This is only a practice exercise for myself. It will involve flow control using if, if else, and else statements, string, numerical, and boolean values, concatenations, global and local scopes, and comparison and logical operators.

## Programs Used

I am using these three programs to create a local JavaScript environment for the purpose of testing my code:

```Visual Studio Code, Cmder, and NodeJS```
